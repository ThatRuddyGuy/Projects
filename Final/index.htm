  <h2>The N7 Soldiers</h2>
  <p>N7 is a special section of the Systems Alliance Military. The "N" declares special forces, and the "7" is indicative of the highest level of training the soldier has gone through. Earning the N7 badge is reserved for the wisest and greatest soldiers out there. Often, N7 soldiers are quickly placed in leadership roles to better benefit the military as a whole.</p>

  <h3>The First Step</h3>
  <p>By reaching this site you have taken the first steps on a long and arduous path to becoming a better galactic citizen. Here you will find the training schedules that our candidates go through each week. No exceptions! Also, on the right you will find links to check out some of our more recognizable soldiers, as well as a link to request more information and get started!</p>

<h3>Joining the Squad</h3>
<p>Before continuing, we do advise that you be aware of the following: We do not encourage unnecessary violence or criminal activity. Any instances of violence or inappropriate behavior will result in an immediate removal from the program and possible fines or prison sentencing. This is a very serious matter. The safety of our universe is not to be taken lightly!</p>
