  <h2>Our Most Memorable</h2>
  <p>Here we will highlight a few of our bravest and most successful soldiers. These soldiers have faced countless life or death situations and came out victorious. It is thanks to these brave individuals that our lives continue to go on without alien invasion.</p>

  <h3>Commander Shepard</h3>
  <p><img src = "images/shepard.jpg" alt = "Shepard" float = "left" width = "100px" height = "100px"/> Commander Shepard is the icon of the human race. Shepard excelled through all N7 training and quickly rose from soldier to leader in the battlefield. After numerous victories, Shepard was selected to become the first Human SPECTRE (Special Tactics and Reconnaissance). This decision was met with fury and skepticism by the other species in the Citadel Defense Program but their doubts were quickly put at ease as Shepard saved the Galaxy time and time again.</p>

  <h3>Grunt - Krogan</h3>
  <p><img src = "images/krogan.jpg" alt = "Grunt" float = "left" width = "100px" height = "100px" /> Grunt serves as the icon of new hope for the Krogan race. The Krogan race was dying out due to sterilization but their top scientists came together to implant one Krogan body with the knowledge and strength of the entire race. When Grunt was released from his growth tank, Commander Shepard greeted him with assertiveness but also kindness and allowed him to select his own name. Grunt felt the name "Grunt" accurately portrayed his upbringing and struggles. Today Grunt serves alongside Commander Shepard and his crew.</p>
  
  <h3>Thane Krios </h3>
  <p><img src = "images/thane.jpg" alt = "Thane" float = "left" width = "100px" height = "100px" /> There is actually very little known about Thane Krios. Thane is a Drell assassin who spent most of his long life assassinating corrupt leaders and others in power positions. Thane met Shepard and his crew during one of those assassinations. After hearing about Shepard's mission, Thane agreed to come along as his last act in life. He was dying from a disease common to his species that causes the lungs to fill with moisture over time and eventually stop the lungs entirely. Thane feels that by assisting Shepard in his mission, it will act as a way of making peace with his past.</p>
